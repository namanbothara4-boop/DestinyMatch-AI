  <h1>About DestinyMatchAI</h1>

  <p>
    DestinyMatchAI is a fun and interactive AI tool designed to calculate compatibility  
    using name-based patterns and behavioral mapping. It gives a quick “vibe score”  
    and personality alignment reading for two names.
  </p>

  <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
  <p>
    I wanted to create a simple tool that anyone can use to check compatibility with  
    their crush, partner, or friend in a playful but meaningful way.
  </p>

  <h2>What It Does</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Analyzes names using AI logic</li>
    <li>Generates a compatibility percentage</li>
    <li>Provides short personality insights</li>
    <li>Works instantly — no data stored</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Plan</h2>
  <p>
    More features are coming soon including matchmaking logic, zodiac compatibility,  
    and personality quizzes.
